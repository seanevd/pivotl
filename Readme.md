#Pivotl
Pivotl is a simple css framework that borrows heavily from Foundation from Zurb. I really liked Foundation, but I find that I am always overwriting previous styles etc.. So I pulled only the grid and some basic resets so I won't be encumbered by having to overwrite other styles provided by Foundation.
